      <description>For this project, I chose to focus on mental health and the resources available in countries worldwide. The first dataset contains the suicide rates of 4 different years from each country. The suicide rates are for both genders combined and are age-standardized. The second dataset contains the amount of mental health specialitists present in the same countries during the year 2016. Each of the values in the second dataset, excluding the year, was per a population of 100000.</description>
