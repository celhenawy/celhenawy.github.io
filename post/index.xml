      <description>You ever wish you had the best of both worlds? Well now you cam with reticulate! R Studio and Python are both excellent softwares and often concieved as rivals. If you ask anyone in the data science field, they either say they are Team R Studio or Team Python. Why can&amp;rsquo;t they be Team Both? With reticulate, now you can! If those in Team R Studio are unfamilar with Python, Python can pretty much complete the same tasks as R Studio.</description>
