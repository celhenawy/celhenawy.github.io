```

You ever wish you had the best of both worlds? Well now you can with reticulate! R Studio and Python are both excellent softwares and often concieved as rivals. If you ask anyone in the data science field, they either say they are Team R Studio or Team Python. Why can't they be Team Both? With reticulate, now you can! If those in Team R Studio are unfamilar with Python, Python can pretty much complete the same tasks as R Studio. Here are some comparison in codes that would be inputted in both softwares to complete the the same tasks: 

Let's first input the dataset used in Project 2! 


R:

```{R}
library(reticulate)
df <- read.csv("heartdata.csv")
head(df)
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("heartdata.csv")
df.head()
```

As you can see, so far, the codes for the same function are similar. Let's find the 5 number summary for the resting blood pressure varibale on each software! 

R:
```{R}
summary(df$restbp)
```


```{python}
df.restbp.mean()
df.restbp.median()
df.restbp.min()
df.restbp.max()
```

As you can see, both codes were straightforward and we obtained the same answers. 

Even though they can complete similar tasks, as shown below, each software has their own benefits. When 
combined together, data scientists can conquer anything! 
Let me show you how to use the function reticulate which allows both softwares to communicate with one another. 

First let's download reticulate and make a fun saying. I will use both softwares to show you that reticulate actually works! 

```{r}
library(reticulate)
austin <- "Happy"
```

```{python}
austin="Holidays!"
print(austin)
```

```{python}
print(r.austin,austin)
```

There you go! Communication! The softwares communicate so well that different words can be named the same thing without any issues!
